Paper, Scissors, Rock Game
Do you remember the games we used to play in our childhood, Rock paper scissors was one of them. Now let's try to play same with or desktop. Here I have made the game using Python programming. I have simply used the logic of loops and conditionals. Output will ask for choice of user, and computer randomly selects its choice. And based on the choices, the winner is declared.
